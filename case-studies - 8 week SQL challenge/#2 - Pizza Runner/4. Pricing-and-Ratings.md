## Case Study Questions - Price & Ratings

1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?

   - Add cheese is $1 extra

3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?

   - customer_id

   - order_id

   - runner_id

   - rating

   - order_time

   - pickup_time

   - Time between order and pickup

   - Delivery duration

   - Average speed

   - Total number of pizzas

5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

## Solutions:

### **1. What is the total revenue for the Pizza Runner if each pizza costs $12 for a Meat Lovers pizza and $10 for any other pizza, and there is no additional charge for extras?**

```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pn.pizza_name='Meatlovers' THEN 12 ELSE 10 END) as total_cost
FROM   temp_customer_orders co 
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
JOIN temp_runner_orders ro USING(order_id)
WHERE  ro.cancellation IS NULL;
```

#### Result set:

| total_cost |
|------------|
| 138        |

---

### **2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?**

- Add cheese is $1 extra.

```sql
WITH pizza_revenue as (
    SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_name='Meatlovers' THEN 12 ELSE 10 END) as base_revenue
    FROM   temp_customer_orders co 
    JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
    JOIN temp_runner_orders ro USING(order_id)
    WHERE  ro.cancellation IS NULL
),
topping_revenue as (
    SELECT SUM(CASE
                 WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras = '' OR extras = 'null' THEN 0
                 ELSE length(extras) - length(replace(extras, ',', '')) + 1
               END) as extra_revenue
    FROM   temp_customer_orders co 
    JOIN temp_runner_orders ro USING(order_id)
    WHERE  ro.cancellation IS NULL
)
SELECT
    (SELECT base_revenue FROM pizza_revenue) + (SELECT extra_revenue FROM topping_revenue) as total_cost;
```

#### Result set:

| total_cost |
|------------|
| 142        |

### **3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner. How would you design an additional table for this new dataset and insert data for ratings (between 1 to 5) for each successful customer order?**

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_rating;

CREATE TABLE runner_rating (
  	order_id INTEGER,
  	rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    comments VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO runner_rating
VALUES 
    (1, 1, 'Really bad service'),
    (2, 1, NULL),
    (3, 2, 'Took too long...'),
    (4, 1, 'Runner was lost, delivered it AFTER an hour. Pizza arrived cold'),
    (5, 4, 'Good service'),
    (6, 5, 'It was great, good service and fast'),
    (8, 1, 'He tossed it on the doorstep, poor service'),
    (10, 5, 'Delicious!, he delivered it sooner than expected too!');

SELECT * FROM runner_rating;
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | rating | comments                                                        |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 1      | Really bad service                                              |
| 2        | 1      | NULL                                                            |
| 3        | 2      | Took too long...                                                |
| 4        | 1      | Runner was lost, delivered it AFTER an hour. Pizza arrived cold |
| 5        | 4      | Good service                                                    |
| 6        | 5      | It was great, good service and fast                             |
| 8        | 1      | He tossed it on the doorstep, poor service                      |
| 10       | 5      | Delicious!, he delivered it sooner than expected too            |

### **4. Using the newly generated table (`runner_rating`) - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?**

- `customer_id`
- `order_id`
- `runner_id`
- `rating`
- `order_time`
- `pickup_time`
- `preparation_time` (difference between `pickup_time` and `order_time` in minutes)
- `delivery_duration`
- `avg_speed` (distance per minute of delivery)
- `total_pizza_count`

```sql
SELECT   
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    runner_id,
    rating,
    order_time,
    pickup_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pickup_time::TIMESTAMP - order_time)) / 60 as preparation_time,
    duration as delivery_duration,
    round(distance::numeric *60 / duration::numeric, 2) as avg_speed,
    count(pizza_id) as total_pizza_count
FROM   
    temp_customer_orders 
JOIN temp_runner_orders USING(order_id)
JOIN runner_rating USING(order_id)
GROUP BY 
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, distance
ORDER BY 
    1, 2;
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | order_id | runner_id | rating | order_time                 | pickup_time               | preparation_time | delivery_duration | avg_speed | total_pizza_count |

### **5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?**

```sql
WITH sales_revenue as (
    SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pn.pizza_name = 'Meat Lovers' THEN 12 ELSE 10 END) as total_sales
    FROM   temp_customer_orders co 
    JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
    JOIN temp_runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
    WHERE  ro.cancellation IS NULL
),
runner_expenses as (
    SELECT SUM(ro.distance::numeric * 0.30) as total_expenses 
    FROM   temp_runner_orders ro
    WHERE  ro.cancellation IS NULL and ro.distance IS NOT NULL 
)
SELECT
    (SELECT total_sales FROM sales_revenue) - (SELECT total_expenses FROM runner_expenses) as leftover_amount;
```

#### Result set:

| leftover_amount |
|-----------------|
| 76.44           |
