### Case Study - Bonus Question: Impact of Expanding Pizza Range

If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas, such as by adding a new pizza like the "Supreme" pizza, there are a few changes required in the existing database design:

1. ### **New Pizza Entry**: A new pizza, **Supreme**, needs to be added to the `pizza_names` table.
2. ### **Toppings for New Pizza**: The toppings for the **Supreme** pizza need to be added to the `pizza_recipes` table, associating the new pizza with the relevant toppings.
3. ### **Potential Updates to Orders and Revenue Tracking**: The new pizza would now be part of the menu, which could affect future customer orders, sales calculations, and revenue tracking.

## Solution :

---

### **Step 1: Add the New Pizza to `pizza_names`**

We will insert the new pizza **Supreme** into the `pizza_names` table with a unique `pizza_id`.

```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_names (pizza_id, pizza_name)
VALUES (3, 'Supreme');
```

This query adds the **Supreme** pizza to the `pizza_names` table.

#### **Result** (`pizza_names` table):

| pizza_id | pizza_name  |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | Meatlovers  |
| 2        | Vegetarian  |
| 3        | Supreme     |

---

### **Step 2: Assign Toppings to the New Pizza**

The **Supreme** pizza should include all the toppings, so we will insert the corresponding `pizza_id` and a list of `topping_id` values into the `pizza_recipes` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_recipes (pizza_id, toppings)
VALUES (3, '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12');
```

This query assigns the **Supreme** pizza the full range of toppings available in the database (IDs 1 through 12).

#### **Result** (`pizza_recipes` table):

| pizza_id | toppings                    |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 1        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10     |
| 2        | 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12           |
| 3        | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |

---

### **Step 3: Verifying the Updates**

We can now verify that the **Supreme** pizza has been added to both the `pizza_names` and `pizza_recipes` tables by performing a join between them.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pizza_names
JOIN pizza_recipes USING(pizza_id);
```

#### **Result** (`pizza_names` and `pizza_recipes` joined):

| pizza_id | pizza_name  | toppings                    |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 1        | Meatlovers  | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10     |
| 2        | Vegetarian  | 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12           |
| 3        | Supreme     | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |

### **Impact of Adding a New Pizza**

1. **Data Design Update**:
   - **New Pizza**: A new row for the **Supreme** pizza is added in the `pizza_names` table.
   - **New Toppings**: A new set of toppings (all toppings) are associated with the **Supreme** pizza in the `pizza_recipes` table.

2. **Future Orders**:
   - As the new pizza is now available in the menu, customers may start ordering it, and the order system will need to handle this new pizza, including pricing and topping options.
   - The `temp_customer_orders` and `temp_runner_orders` tables would be impacted as they record customer orders involving the **Supreme** pizza.

3. **Sales and Revenue**:
   - The `pizza_sales` table or similar revenue tracking systems would need to account for the **Supreme** pizza as part of future sales. 

4. **Scalability**:
   - Adding new pizzas with a similar pattern would not require significant changes in the database schema since the system can scale by inserting new rows in the `pizza_names` and `pizza_recipes` tables. However, the application logic must adapt to handle new pizzas dynamically, especially when dealing with new pizza IDs or toppings.

---

### Final Answer

By expanding the pizza range, the **Supreme** pizza has been successfully added to the menu, and the corresponding data for toppings has been linked to this new pizza in the database. Future orders can now include this new pizza, and the system can track its sales and revenue just like any other pizza on the menu.
