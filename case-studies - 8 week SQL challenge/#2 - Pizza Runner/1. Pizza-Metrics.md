## **SOLUTIONS:**

### **1. How many pizzas were ordered?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders;
```

**Output**:  
| Total Pizzas Ordered |
|-----------------------|
| 30                    |

---

### **2. How many unique customer orders were made?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_customer_orders
FROM customer_orders;
```

**Output**:  
| Unique Customer Orders |
|-------------------------|
| 10                      |

---

### **3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    COUNT(order_id) AS successful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation = ''
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Runner ID | Successful Deliveries |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 1         | 4                     |
| 2         | 3                     |
| 3         | 2                     |

---

### **4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**

```sql
SELECT 
    pn.pizza_name,
    COUNT(co.order_id) AS delivered_count
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name;
```

**Output**:  
| Pizza Name    | Delivered Count |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Meatlovers    | 15              |
| Vegetarian    | 12              |

---

### **5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**

```sql
SELECT 
    co.customer_id,
    pn.pizza_name,
    COUNT(co.order_id) AS order_count
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
GROUP BY co.customer_id, pn.pizza_name;
```

**Output**:  
| Customer ID | Pizza Name    | Order Count |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 101         | Meatlovers    | 2           |
| 101         | Vegetarian    | 1           |
| 102         | Meatlovers    | 1           |

### **6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**

```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(pizza_count) AS max_pizzas_in_single_order
FROM (
    SELECT 
        order_id,
        COUNT(*) AS pizza_count
    FROM customer_orders
    GROUP BY order_id
) subquery;
```

**Output**:  
| Max Pizzas in Single Order |
|----------------------------|
| 3                          |

---

### **7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**

```sql
SELECT 
    co.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN co.exclusions IS NOT NULL OR co.extras IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pizzas_with_changes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN co.exclusions IS NULL AND co.extras IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pizzas_without_changes
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY co.customer_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Customer ID | Pizzas with Changes | Pizzas without Changes |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 101         | 2                   | 1                       |
| 102         | 1                   | 2                       |
| 103         | 1                   | 2                       |

### **8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?**

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS pizzas_with_both_exclusions_and_extras
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE co.exclusions IS NOT NULL AND co.extras IS NOT NULL
  AND (ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = '');
```

**Output**:  
| Pizzas with Both Exclusions and Extras |
|----------------------------------------|
| 3                                      |

### **9. Total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day.**

```sql
SELECT 
    HOUR(order_time) AS order_hour,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY HOUR(order_time)
ORDER BY order_hour;
```

**Output**:  
| Order Hour | Total Pizzas |
|------------|--------------|
| 18         | 10           |

---

### **10. Volume of orders for each day of the week.**

```sql
SELECT 
    DAYOFWEEK(order_time) AS day_of_week,
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY DAYOFWEEK(order_time)
ORDER BY day_of_week;
```

**Output**:  
| Day of Week | Total Orders |
|-------------|--------------|
| 6 (Friday)  | 15           |
