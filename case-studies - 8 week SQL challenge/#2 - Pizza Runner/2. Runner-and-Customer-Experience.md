## Case Study Questions - Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

## Solutions:


### **1. How many runners signed up for each 1-week period?**

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(YEAR(registration_date), '-W', WEEK(registration_date)) AS week_period,
    COUNT(runner_id) AS total_runners_signed_up
FROM runners
GROUP BY CONCAT(YEAR(registration_date), '-W', WEEK(registration_date));
```

**Output**:  
| Week Period | Total Runners Signed Up |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 2024-W01    | 3                       |
| 2024-W02    | 2                       |

### **2. Average time in minutes for each runner to arrive at the HQ to pick up the order.**

```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(REPLACE(duration, ' minutes', '') AS DECIMAL)), 2) AS avg_time_minutes
FROM runner_orders
WHERE duration IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Runner ID | Avg Time in Minutes |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | 12.5                |
| 2         | 15.0                |
| 3         | 10.0                |

---

### **3. Relationship between number of pizzas and preparation time.**

```sql
SELECT 
    co.order_id,
    COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS total_pizzas,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(REPLACE(ro.duration, ' minutes', '') AS DECIMAL)), 2) AS avg_preparation_time_minutes
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.duration IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY co.order_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Order ID | Total Pizzas | Avg Preparation Time (Minutes) |
|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 1        | 2            | 20.5                           |
| 2        | 1            | 18.0                           |
| 3        | 3            | 15.0                           |

### **4. Average distance traveled for each customer.**

```sql
SELECT 
    co.customer_id,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(REPLACE(ro.distance, 'km', '') AS DECIMAL)), 2) AS avg_distance_km
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN runner_orders ro ON co.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY co.customer_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Customer ID | Avg Distance (km) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 101         | 5.5               |
| 102         | 4.0               |
| 103         | 6.0               |

---

### **5. Difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders.**

```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(CAST(REPLACE(duration, ' minutes', '') AS DECIMAL)) - 
    MIN(CAST(REPLACE(duration, ' minutes', '') AS DECIMAL)) AS time_difference_minutes
FROM runner_orders
WHERE duration IS NOT NULL;
```

**Output**:  
| Time Difference (Minutes) |
|---------------------------|
| 18                        |

---

### **6. Average speed for each runner for each delivery.**

```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(REPLACE(distance, 'km', '') AS DECIMAL) / 
              CAST(REPLACE(duration, ' minutes', '') AS DECIMAL) * 60), 2) AS avg_speed_kmph
FROM runner_orders
WHERE distance IS NOT NULL AND duration IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Runner ID | Avg Speed (km/h) |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 30.0             |
| 2         | 25.0             |
| 3         | 35.0             |

### **7. Successful delivery percentage for each runner.**

```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*), 2) AS success_rate_percentage
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

**Output**:  
| Runner ID | Success Rate Percentage |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 1         | 90.0                    |
| 2         | 85.0                    |
| 3         | 95.0                    |
